/*

A structure is a class whose members are by default public.

Remember that all of the members of class are by default private.

Structures are defined using the same syntax as the class except that the keywords 'struct' is used instead of 'class'.

Note: Do not run the the code you will get an error because on line 13 and on line 21 both 'struct' and 'class' have same name (i.e. ABC).
